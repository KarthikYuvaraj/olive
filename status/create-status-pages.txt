* How to create status pages

	Create masterinfos for Indigo. The following assemblies are targeted:

	- System.Runtime.Serialization.dll
	- System.IdentityModel.dll
	- System.IdentityModel.Selectrors.dll
	- System.ServiceModel.dll

	They are in .NET GAC (%WINDOWS%\assembly\GAC_MSIL). Note that usually
	you cannot access there from Explorer. Use cygwin or cmd.exe.

	Copy those files to masterinfos.

	Once run "make" here ("status" directory). Ignore missing file error.
	Move "masterinfos" directory and run gen-all.sh.

	Move back here and run "make".

	Status pages are under ./deploy.
