Welcome to Windows Workflow Foundation Mono implementation

Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) has been introduced as part of Microsoft .Net 3.0 framework (formerly called WinFX). It is a namespace and a set of tools designed for building workflow enabled applications on .Net.

WF is implemented using three assemblies: System.Workflow.Activities, System.Workflow.ComponentModel and System.Workflow.Runtime.

Visit http://www.mono-project.com/Workflow for a complete description of this namespace.
