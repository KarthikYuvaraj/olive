	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs: Fix function name.

2007-08-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* WebApplication.cs: initParams doesn't require a key=value string
	according to the docs
	(http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb417075.aspx). In the
	"param1, param2" case just add the keys.

	* WebApplication.cs: populate the StartupArgs dictionary based on
	the plugin's initParams.

2007-07-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs: Expose some of these methods
	(maybe we should move them to agmono?).
	- Add value<->npobj support

	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs: more gross stuff.  add event
	adding/emitting.

2007-07-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebApplication.cs, ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs: rework the
	scriptable object stuff pretty substantially.  separate type
	validation from the generation of the wrapper object.  This is so
	that eventually with events we won't need to validate the type
	whenever we wrap event args (since we'll already have validated it
	during the course of validating the class containing the
	scriptable event.)  Also, fix property sets, gets, and invocation.
	everything except events should be working.  Also, leave a comment
	about the Binder implementation (and how it's not necessaryin the
	long term.)

	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs (InvokeFromUnmanaged): marshal the
	args manually.

2007-07-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs: change InvokeFromUnmanaged to take
	an IntPtr[] for its args, instead of Value[], and do the
	marshalling manually.  this gets the bubblemark start/stop links
	working.

2007-07-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs: implement this in terms of the
	plugin p/invokes for scriptable object wrappers.

	* WebApplication.cs: rename "instance" to "plugin_handle", and
	ScriptableObjectGenerator doesn't return a string now - it
	actually creates the wrapper class in the plugin.

	* WebApplication.cs : more impl. based on assumed PInvokes.

2007-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ScriptableObjectGenerator.cs : generate javascript object from
	  [Scriptable] object.
	* WebApplication.cs : use above (still nothing works)

2007-06-06  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* WebApplication.cs : some code, still does nothing.

2007-06-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ApplicationUnhandledExceptionEventArgs.cs WebApplication.cs :
	  (practically) stubs.
