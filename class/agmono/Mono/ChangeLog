	* Helper.cs: Add helper methods used in System.SilverLight.

2007-08-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Helper.cs: Add two helper methods that access the mscorlib
	internal methods to manage AppDomains.   This is necessary because
	we do not want to become friends with moonlight.exe (it is not
	installed in the GAC or anything like that).   So instead we
	become friends with agmono.

	Move some code here that was duplicated in
	XamlReader.cs and in moonlight.cs.    We are doing this to friend
	agmono.dll to our 2.1 System assembly.   

	This is needed because agmono has access to a few internals that
	are not exposed by the 2.1 API.
