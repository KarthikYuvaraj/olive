	* Dispatcher.cs: Move all tasks, not only the first one from the
	async queue into the proper priority queues.

	Eliminate the `Task' class, it is mostly redundant, instead move
	all the data into DispatcherOperation.
	
	* DispatcherOperation.cs, DispatcherOperationStatus.cs: Add new
	files. 

	* Dispatcher.cs: Make our class `Task' internal, so we can pass
	that to DispatcherOperation.

	* Dispatcher.cs: Queue will now queue
	locally (if same thread) or post to the dispatcher queue if
	invoked from a different thread.

	* Dispatcher.cs: Initially I thought this
	was a stroke of genius.   Looking at the actual results, it does
	not seem as brilliant as I had hoped.
