	* TimelineGroup.cs: use MS's broken, broken Children property -
	not a TimelineCollection, but a single Timeline.  This will more
	than likely be fixed in the next revision of Silverlight, but for
	now it's needed to run the airlines demo unmodified.

	* Storyboard.cs: analogous change to Event.cs for
	CrossDomainProxy.

	* Storyboard.cs: make a similar change as I made to UIElement.cs.
