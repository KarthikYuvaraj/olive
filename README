This module contains libraries that are under a different schedule than the
rest of Mono.

To build:

	./configure [--prefix=/yourprefix] [--with-moonlight=yes|no]

	make

To install:

	make prefix=yourprefix

It defaults to the Mono installation prefix

* Silverlight Assemblies

	By default, --with-moonlight is enabled, which means that the 2.1
	assemblies for Moonlight will be build. You can de-activate that
	by configuring olive --with-moonlight=no.

	Since Moonlight exposes both a 2.1 profile and a profile that
	can be used on our desktop applications you will find two sets
	of .pc files to use with pkgconfig.

	silver.pc:
		This one references the 2.1 APIs, and this is what
	 	the smcs compiler should use.

	silverdesktop.pc:
		These one is for use with the desktop and Gtk# applications.

		The only difference between silver.pc and silver
