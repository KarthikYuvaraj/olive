	* Makefile, samplecli5.cs, samplesvc5.cs : basically the same as
	  sample 4, but the contract is Message-based.
	* samplesvc4.cs : tiny additional comment.

	* samplecli4.cs, samplesvc4.cs : reduced several lines to simplify
	  sample 3 (and they still work together).

	* samplecli4.cs, samplesvc4.cs : new files, for now just copy of
	  sample 3.
	* Makefile : added above. Added Inspector.cs to sample 1.
	* Inspector.cs : indent output.

	* samplecli.cs, samplesvc.cs, samplecli3.cs, samplesvc3.cs :
	  finally got sample 3 working fine on .NET, by making its ws-policy
	  equivalent to sample (1).

	* Makefile, samplecli3.cs, samplesvc3.cs : new low-level example 
	  (without WSHttpBinding), but the reply is still invalid (on .NET).
	  Anyways now mono service can decrypt the message from .NET client.
	* samplecli2.cs, samplesvc2.cs : removed metadata behavior and
	  added inspector instead.

2006-09-06  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* samplecli2.cs, samplesvc2.cs : added UserNamePassword example.
	* Makefile : added above.
	* samplecli.cs, samplesvc.cs, Inspector.cs : added some debug stuff.

	* Makefile, samplesvc.cs, samplecli.cs, test.pfx : new sample files.
